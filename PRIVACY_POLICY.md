# Privacy Policy

Tim Stair built the open source CardMaker application. This application is provided by Tim Stair at no cost and is intended for use as-is.

This page is used to inform website visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decides to use the application.

# Information Gathered

Nothing. There is no personally indentifiable, or anonymous, information gathered by the CardMaker application. No information is transmitted anywhere for my use. There is local logging viewable within the application, but that is intended for your own use as you operate the application.

## Google Data Transmission

If you choose to use Google Spreadsheets with the CardMaker application, permission must be given by you so the application may access your sheets. This process uses Google OAUTH2 (https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2). When permission is requested a secure token is transmitted via your web browser involving a web page I personally maintain. The token and any personally identifiable information is NOT collected by me or the CardMaker application. Any token use is limited to your running instance of CardMaker.

Please refer to the appropricate Google privacy policy for usage of Google Spreasheets.
